Guile AgentX
============

You have written a great piece of software, and of course you
extended it with the Guile. Now it's time to add this little killer
feature : the possibility to monitor your software via SNMP.

This is easy with this small library : run net-snmp (or any other
SNMP master agent that implements the AgentX protocol) and implement
your MIB within guile !

See the example.scm file for a exemple.
